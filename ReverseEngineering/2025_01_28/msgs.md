*Assalam O Alaikum Everyone!* ðŸ‘‹  
Welcome to the *Reverse Engineering Course!* ðŸŽ‰  
Weâ€™re excited to have you here. This course, brought to you by the *Cyber Hacktivators Club,* is designed to take you from beginner to intermediate level in reverse engineering. Whether youâ€™re new to reverse engineering or looking to sharpen your skills, this course will provide you with the foundational knowledge and hands-on experience needed to analyze and manipulate software.  

*What to Expect*  
The course will focus on understanding software internals, dissecting binaries, and uncovering vulnerabilities. It will involve both self-paced learning and practical challenges, emphasizing real-world applications of reverse engineering.  

*Prerequisites*  
To get the most out of this course, you should have:  
- _Basic Programming Skills_: Familiarity with C/C++ and Python.  
- _Understanding of Computer Architecture_: Basic Knowledge of x86/x64 assembly and memory management.  
- _Command Line Proficiency_: Ability to navigate and use terminal commands.  
- _Desire to Learn_: Donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re not an expert yet! Weâ€™ll guide you step by step.  

*Course Milestones*  
1. Introduction to Reverse Engineering  
2. Understanding Disassemblers and Debuggers (IDA Pro/Ghidra/Radare2)  
3. Assembly Language x86-64 I  
4. Assembly Language x86-64 II  
5. Static and Dynamic Analysis Techniques  
6. Analyzing Executables: PE, ELF, etc.  
7. Unpacking and Deobfuscation Techniques  
8. Exploiting Anti-Debugging Mechanisms  
9. Binary Instrumentation and Hooking Techniques  
10. Malware Analysis Basics  
11. Reverse Engineering for Vulnerability Research  
12. Advanced Topics: Reconstructing Algorithms, Patch Analysis, etc.  

*How It Works*  
- *Self-Paced Learning*: Materials and resources will be shared to let you learn at your own pace.  
- *Hands-On Practice*: Challenges will include analyzing binaries, breaking protections, and documenting findings through writeups.  
- *Certification*: Completing 80% of the challenges with proper writeups will earn you a certification.  
- *Collaborative Learning*: Questions and discussions should be shared in the *Cyber Discussion Group.*  

*Tools Youâ€™ll Need*  
- *Disassemblers*: IDA Pro (free version), Ghidra, or Radare2  
- *Debuggers*: x64dbg or GDB  
- *Virtualization*: VMware, VirtualBox, or QEMU for isolated testing environments  
- *Decompilers*: Binary Ninja, Hopper (optional)  
- *Hex Editors*: HxD, 010 Editor, or Hex Fiend  
- *GitHub*: Create a *GitHub account* (if you donâ€™t have one) and follow the _https://github.com/Cyber-Hacktivators-Club/L2CourseMaterial_ (it will keep updating).

Prepare your note-taking system (e.g., Notion, Obsidian, paper) and ensure you have a secure and isolated setup for practical work.  

*Letâ€™s Get Started!*  
The *Reverse Engineering Course* will equip you with the skills to analyze and manipulate software effectively. With patience and practice, youâ€™ll gain the ability to uncover vulnerabilities and understand how software truly works.  

Letâ€™s dive into the fascinating world of reverse engineering together! ðŸš€  
*Best of luck to everyone!*
