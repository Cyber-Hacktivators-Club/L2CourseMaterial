*Assalam O Alaikum Everyone!* ðŸ‘‹  

Welcome to the *Web & Mobile Exploitation Course!* ðŸŽ‰  
Weâ€™re thrilled to have you here. This course, brought to you by the *Cyber Hacktivators Club,* is designed to take you from beginner to intermediate level in web and mobile exploitation. Whether youâ€™re just starting out or looking to expand your skills, this course will help you build a strong foundation and progress into advanced techniques.  

*What to Expect*  
This course is aligned with some *Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)* topics for web exploitation and follows the *OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)* for mobile exploitation. Expect a mix of self-paced learning and hands-on practice, where experimentation and critical thinking will be key to your success.  

*Prerequisites*  
To make the most out of this course, you should have:  
* _Basic Understanding of Web Development_: Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web technologies.  
* _Command Line Basics_: You should be comfortable navigating and running commands in the terminal.  
* _Networking Fundamentals_: Basic knowledge of HTTP(S), DNS, and other essential protocols.  
* _Desire to Learn_: If youâ€™re new to web or mobile exploitation, donâ€™t worry! Weâ€™ll guide you step by step.

*Course Milestones*  

*Web Exploitation Topics*  
1. Understanding Web Application Architecture  
2. Identifying Vulnerabilities: SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.  
3. Authentication and Authorization Attacks  
4. Bypassing Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)  
5. Exploiting File Upload and Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities  
6. Advanced Web Exploitation: Business Logic and Deserialization Vulnerabilities  

*Mobile Exploitation Topics (Based on MASVS)*  
1. Mobile Application Architecture (iOS/Android)  
2. Reverse Engineering APK/IPA Files  
3. Static and Dynamic Analysis of Mobile Apps  
4. Exploiting Insecure Data Storage  
5. Exploiting Improper Authentication and Session Management  
6. Network Communication Attacks on Mobile Apps  
7. Tampering and Code Injection  
8. Advanced Exploitation Techniques  

*How It Works*  
* *Self-Paced Learning*: Materials and resources will be shared to let you learn at your own pace.  
* *Hands-On Practice*: Real-world challenges will be provided for each topic to ensure practical understanding. Participants are required to solve these challenges and submit detailed writeups.  
* *Certification*: Completing 80% of the challenges with proper writeups will earn you a certification.  
* *Collaborative Learning*: All discussions, queries, and problem-solving should be shared in the *Cyber Discussion Group.*  

*Additional Details*  
* *Note-Taking*: Effective notes are essential for learning. You can use apps like Notion, Obsidian, or traditional methods like paper and mind maps.  
* *Challenges*: Files for challenges will be shared in ZIP format, including instructions, resources, and hints. The web challenges will have DockerFile provided, so it's recommended that you setup Docker and get a bit comfortable with it.  
* *Meetings*: Short meetings will be conducted only to address challenge-related queries and *onRequest*.  

*Letâ€™s Get Started!*  
The *Web & Mobile Exploitation Course* will help you master the skills needed for real-world penetration testing and ethical hacking. With dedication and curiosity, youâ€™ll gain valuable expertise in uncovering vulnerabilities and understanding security flaws.  

Letâ€™s dive in and explore the exciting world of web and mobile exploitation together! ðŸš€  

*Best of luck to everyone!*
