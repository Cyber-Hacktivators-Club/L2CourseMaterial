Assalam O Alaikum everyone! 👋

Welcome to the Binary Exploitation Course! 🎉 We’re excited to have you all here. This course is being offered by Cyber Hacktivators Club and is designed to take you from beginner to intermediate level in binary exploitation. While it won’t be entirely beginner-friendly, we’ll cover the basics and gradually move into more advanced topics.

What to Expect
This course will involve a mix of self-paced learning and hands-on practice. You’ll be provided with course materials, but a lot of the learning will come from research, experimentation, and tweaking system internals.

Prerequisites
To get the most out of this course, you should have:

● Strong knowledge of command line, operating systems and cybersecurity concepts 
● Basic knowledge of assembly language (x86/x86_64).
● Some experience with reverse engineering and debugging tools like GDB.

Don’t worry if you’re not fully comfortable with these yet—we’ll start from the basics and build up!

Course Milestones
Here’s what we’ll cover:

1. Assembly Language (x86/x86_64) and GDB
2. PwnDBG, IDA, and Shellcoding
3. Exploiting Stack-Based Buffer Overflows
4. Bypassing Common Stack Overflow Protections
5. Exploiting Format String Vulnerabilities
6. ROP Chains and Bypassing Binary Protections
7. Other Common Exploitation Techniques
8. Logic Bugs (Timing Attacks, Cryptographic Vulnerabilities, Integer Overflows, etc.)
9. Heap Basics
10. Exploiting Heap Allocators
11. Fuzzing and Symbolic Execution

How It Works
● Self-Paced Learning: Learning materials and resources will be shared for you to study at your own pace.
● Hands-On Practice: Challenges will be shared covering different techniques and tackling edge cases. You  have to solve the challenges and provide writeup in the given forms for each milestone. 
● Certification: Complete 80% of the challenges and submit your writeups to earn a certification.
● Collaboration: Feel free to ask questions, share insights, and help each other out.

Additional Details
● Note-Taking: Taking notes is extremely important throughout the course and while solving challenges. If you don’t take proper notes, you may get confused and end up relearning the same concepts repeatedly. You can use any note-taking app of your choice, such as: Paper notes, Xmind (for mind maps), Notion, Obsidian, GitBooks. It’s all about personal preference—choose what works best for you!
● Challenges: Challenges will be provided in zip formats (unless an external server is required). Each zip file will contain: Challenge files, A README file with instructions and additional resources to help you tackle the challenge
● Discussion:  To ensure smooth communication and avoid clutter, general discussions will be disabled in this group. Only instructors will be able to send messages here. All questions, discussions, and conversations related to learning and challenges should be posted in the Cyber Discussion Group.
● Meetings: We are shifting away from regular meetings. Instead, we will hold short meetings every 1-2 days. These meetings will focus exclusively on challenge-related queries and problems.

Let’s Get Started!
We’re here to support you throughout the course. If you have any questions or need help, don’t hesitate to ask in the group. Let’s make this a fun and productive learning experience for everyone!

Best of luck, and let’s dive in! 🚀

We will be starting the course on Thursday. In the meantime, please take a look at this course:
● https://apps.p.ost2.fyi/learning/course/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+Arch1001_x86-64_Asm+2021_v1/home
It is a short course and will cover the prerequisites and will provide a refresher on assembly language for those already familiar with Intel x86 and Intel x86_64 Assembly.
Along with it, please make sure to have your Kali or any other Linux-based VMs ready as well.
